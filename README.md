Working UDP Services![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a058dd4-2c5c-4778-a519-08106c4fcca8)
User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a simple protocol that makes a best effort to deliver data to a remote host
The UDP protocol is connectionless protocol thus UDP datagrams sent to the remote endpoint are not guaranteed to arrive and they arenâ€™t guaranteed to arrive in the same sequence in which they are sent. Applications that use UDP must be prepared to handle missing, duplicate, and out-of-sequence datagrams
The UdpClient class communicates with network services using UDP. The properties and methods of the UdpClient class abstract the details of creating a Socket for requesting and receiving data using UDP
